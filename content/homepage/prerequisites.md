During the Hackathon climate data from km-scale simulations with the Unified Model and other models will be provided in Healpix format at different zoom levels. Jupyter Notebooks will be provided to explain the basics of the data handling. Participants can then develop their own Jupyter Notebooks or python scripts to analyze and plot the data.

Participants are expected to have basic knowledge of:
 * Linux terminal
 * Python, including Matplotlib, Numpy, Xarray
 * Concepts of data visualization
 * Handling of global 2D and 3D data fields in Meteorology or Climate science
