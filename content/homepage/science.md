The science topics for all nodes fall under two umbrella themes: 1) organised travelling convection and 2) circulation, which are closely related. As part of the investigations, there are working groups on tracking (of TCs, MCSs, MJO); characteristics of precipitation, e.g. large scale versus convective, spectra, diurnal cycle; atmospheric blocking; air-sea and land-atmosphere coupling, etc.
The UK plans to explore a hierarchy of simulations from the Met Office K-scale project, from global to regional, to investigate:

1. Convection under a range of simulation approaches, e.g. the dependence on resolution, domain size, type of convective parametrisation
2. Weather systems, such as TCs and MCSs, and their interaction with the large scale circulation
3. Upscale effects of a number of phenomena, with initial focus on TCs, and how they affect the large scale circulation
4. Cloud tracking across models using state-of-the art tools (e.g. PyFLEXTRKR,  tobac) and will expand on analysis of cloud spatial structure using multifractal and computer vision approaches. 
5. The Oxford group will also work on global km-scale ICON runs with explicit aerosols conducted within NextGEMS.

Science Questions:

1. Are weather systems, and their interactions with the large-scale flow, significantly different, depending on the use of convective parametrisation in the various DYAMOND-3 simulations?
2. Can we detect significant contributions to the large-scale flow by the existence of MCSs and TCs, including the ones in the top categories?
3. What are the characteristics of precipitation under different treatments of resolution, parametrisation (including aerosol), coupling?
4. Having established the degree of simulation fidelity, based on the analyses of phenomena and processes above, are any of the participating models good/valuable candidates for ML training?
5. What new science emerges robustly across the models taking part in DYAMOND-3? Examples:
    1. strength and process-chain for UPSCALE effects emerging from analysis of TCs and MCSs
    2. quality of the precipitation fields as revealed by comparison with latest observations, and in preparation for EarthCARE
    3. are there universal lessons on the value of simulation at these scales, e.g. in terms of results that are robust across model families?

Approach:
A number of data sets will be made available on the JASMIN object store, in HEALPix format, and accessible remotely. Notebooks to perform the analyses above, at least at an initial stage, will be provided to all, including catalogues for data discovery. Observational products will also be provided, e.g. ERA5, IMERG, CERES. Many of the more complex data sets, e.g. TC tracks, MCS tracks, will be provided before the event.
Multiple working groups of 5 or more individuals  will be formed around the topics above, and will work together at the venue, as well as identify equivalent groups at other nodes to exchange information with on a daily basis.
